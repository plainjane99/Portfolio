## Description of Challenge <a name="description"></a>

Week 7 and Week 8 were "Project 1" weeks for the UCLA Extension Full Stack Development Bootcamp.  The goal of Project 1 was to bring a small group together to work on an interactive Front-End Project that would take the team through building an application from scratch by using all of the tools learned to date.  Once the project was completed, part of the grading criteria was to update my portfolio with the Project 1 URL.  

* This Portfolio 2.0 corrects the animation issues from the 1.0 portfolio.   
* This Portfolio 2.0 improves the responsiveness of the page.
* This Portfolio 2.0 adds the links to respective project live URLs.
* Revises the About-Me section with more recent information as well as additional useful information.

## Execution of the Challenge <a name="execution"></a>

I enjoyed updating my portfolio as I was able to discover exactly how much I have learned only 4-6 weeks after I submitted the 1.0 version of this portfolio.  I was very quickly able to fix the issues I had with v1.0 by restructuring some of the HTML/CSS or applying the correct semantics.  Although we have learned about alternate frameworks such as Bootstrap, I decided to stick with my original css as it feels more creative to have to style everything from scratch.  

## Lessons-Learned <a name="lessons"></a>

There were no significant lessons-learned from updating my portfolio.

## More A-ha in the Future, aka Challenges to Get Over <a name="challenges"></a>

The challenges I know I have ahead of me include:

1. Event Handling, DOM Manipulation, and Writing Functions - I am keeping these three as challenges until I feel more comfortable with the topics.
2. Flex Box - Flex box is still not completely intuitive.  Even in updating my portfolio, I would apply properties and find that nothing would happen.  I will have to review the documentation further.   

Thanks for reading this README.md.
