## Description of Challenge <a name="description"></a>

The Week 2 Challenge for the UCLA Extension Full Stack Development Bootcamp was to create a portfolio of my work.  The portfolio serves as a device to demonstrate my capabilities as a developer to employers.  For this particular exercise, the portfolio was also to challenge me to create my first webpage without direct written instruction.  To meet the acceptance criteria, it required me to use everything I have learned over the last two weeks.  Specifically, the acceptance criteria included:  

* Write HTML and CSS for a webpage that would present an employer with a portfolio of information.
* The portfolio is to include developer name, a recent photo, and sections about me, my work, and my contact information.
* The portfolio is to have a navigation bar that links to the sections about me, my work, and my contact information and then scrolls to the corresponding section.
* The section about my work is to include titled images of my applications where my first application should be showcased with larger sizing. Application images should deploy to that application.
* The portfolio is to resize with various screens and devices.
* Animation functionality should be applied to the work section of the portfolio.

During development of the portfolio, I was also to practice with Git and GitHub by adding, committing, and pushing my code as if part of a development team.  Once the acceptance criteria were met, the challenge was to be deployed to a live URL through GitHub and to have the webpage load with no errors.  

## Execution of the Challenge <a name="execution"></a>

Overall, I found this to be another excellent challenge, like it's Week 1 predecessor.  The week's written Run Buddy lessons are relatively easy to follow and, since so much of the code is written out in the lesson, it is very easy to mindlessly type what is shown on the screen.  Once faced without any starter code for this challenge, it was interesting to see just how much I was actually able to execute.  I discovered what I understood very well and what I understood more poorly.

__What I Understood Well__ included writing out the structure of the webpage, adding general content, adding navigation, and adding general css styling to the webpage.  I was able to put together a rough webpage fairly quickly.

__What Took A Little More Time__ but were good "A-ha" moments was understanding how to use flex-box and CSS grid.  The instructor provided a good explanation of CSS grid during class but the class exercise was not meant to be especially difficult because of available time.  The Run Buddy lessons provided multiple instances of the use of flex-box but I did not completely understand all of the different properties that were being applied.  Once it was time to use the layouts on my own in a more complicated setting, it took quite a few hours before I felt I knew what was going on.

I also got to revisit my other struggle, which was understanding the use of absolute versus relative positioning.  I believe I have a better understanding of how to position an image, but using the position property within flexbox is still not that entirely clear.

__What I Am Struggling With__ is completing the challenge to meet two of the acceptance criteria as the challenge intended: 1. applying animation per the mock-up and 2. applying a link that will deploy to a project.  I do not believe the difficulty is creating the code for these two aspects, but more related to making an error somewhere else in the code that prevents further progression.  Throughout the execution of this specific challenge, I believe I racked up at least 8 hours of just trying to debug my code.  It always felt great when I was able to find the solution, but it was certainly a painful process to get there.

In regards to the animation, I believe there is an error in the html structure in which my css grid is encompassed.  Currently the animation is being applied to the overall css grid container because it was the only location I could get it to work.  The animation should be applied to the individual project boxes, but unfortunately I was unable to come up with a solution before needing to submit this challenge.

I also ran out of time to apply the link to the Run Buddy project image so that it would deploy to the application.

## Lessons-Learned <a name="lessons"></a>

This week's Lessons-Learned include:

1. Flex Box - When I started this challenge, I thought about coming up with my own design for the Portfolio page, but in the end, I'm glad I stuck with replicating the Mock-up Portfolio.  It is a very simple design, but it was excellent at teaching the use of flex box.  I had a lot of a-ha moments with figure out how to use the different flex box properties.

2. CSS Grid - The biggest a-ha in using CSS grid was finally understanding what a "fr" unit really is/does.  With that small piece of information, I feel like I could create any type of grid design in the future.

## More A-ha in the Future, aka Challenges to Get Over <a name="challenges"></a>

The challenges I know I have ahead of me include:

1. Becoming comfortable with setting up my repository in Git and GitHub.
2. Understanding flex box properties more clearly and when to use them.
3. Understanding how CSS grid works with html containers...either that or...
4. Feeling more confident in what I do understand so that I don't break my code even more when I try to debug.  :)

Thanks for reading this README.md.
